## Description

[1]: Contains the R markdown notebook explaining the methods and thinking process used for the different spatial interpolation methods. This notebook contains a complete overview of the steps but not the code used for training of the weights.

[2]: Contains the R code for the dynamic training routine used to find ideal weights and storing the results. 

[3]: Contains the code extending the pesticide dispersion model to include each windspeed interpolation method individually and storing the results. 

[4]: Contains the R markdown notebook explaining and showing the results of the different validation metrics used for the spatial interpolation methods and dispersion model using results from files [2] and [3].

[5]: Folder containing all of the data sources used for the code or generated by the code.

[6]: Folder containing all of the data sources used by the dispersion model and the code of the disperion model itself.
